This Python code is an implementation of a simple linear regression model using gradient descent for training. It is applied to the USA_Housing dataset, which  contains information about housing prices in the USA.

Here's a brief description of the key components and functionalities of the code:

Data Loading and Exploration:
The code begins by importing necessary libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib.
The 'USA_Housing.csv' dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame (df).
Some basic exploratory data analysis is performed, including displaying the first few rows of the dataset, checking for missing values, and plotting relationships between features and the target variable (Price).


Data Visualization:
Various Matplotlib plots are created to visualize the relationships between different features and the housing prices.
Plots include scatter plots for 'Area Population' vs. 'Price', bar plots for 'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms' vs. 'Price', and subplots for selected columns against 'Price'.
A horizontal bar plot is generated to display the top 10 addresses with the highest average housing prices.


Data Splitting:
The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn.

Gradient Descent Implementation:
The code defines a linear regression model with a prediction function (predict), cost function (compute_cost), and gradient computation function (compute_gradient).
The gradient_descent function performs the gradient descent optimization to learn the weights (w_final) and bias (b_final) of the linear regression model.
The training process involves iterating through the dataset, updating the weights and bias, and storing the cost values at regular intervals.

Training the Model:
The model is trained on the training dataset with specified hyperparameters such as the learning rate and the number of iterations.
The progress of the training is printed to the console, displaying the cost at regular intervals.
